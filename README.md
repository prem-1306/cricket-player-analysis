📊 Cricket Player Performance Analysis
This project analyzes a simulated cricket player's performance across 30 matches using NumPy.
The goal is to study batting performance, strike rates, consistency, and scoring patterns with statistical insights.

🚀 Features
Generate synthetic match data (runs, balls, fours, sixes).
Calculate key performance metrics:
Minimum, maximum, and average runs.
Strike rate per match and overall average.
Boundary percentage and dependency on boundaries vs singles/doubles.
50+ and 100+ scores count.
Ducks (0 runs) detection.
Series-wise analysis (every 5 matches grouped).
Correlation between runs scored and balls faced.
Standard deviation of runs (consistency check).
Highlight key matches (best & worst performances).
Final dataset output with detailed statistics
